# MSQL_Data_Analysis
I have used PosgreSQL for my SQL DATABASE. 
Please you can use the lnk attached: [https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.postgresql.org/&ved=2ahUKEwj-k_qkodCMAxUzbvUHHRzzBj4QFnoECAoQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0He1mmeTUi_lhXjiRGJtzr](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

The database is for living cost analysis in Dhaka City for some months. 
I have created, added,  updated and deciphered some answers by the SQL queries.(will continue updating it).
