# MSQL_Data_Analysis
I have used PosgreSQL for my SQL DATABASE. 
You can use the link attached: (https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads) for the download of the PostgreSQL. 

The database is for living cost analysis in Dhaka City for some months. 
I have created, added,  updated and deciphered some answers by the SQL queries.(will continue updating it).
